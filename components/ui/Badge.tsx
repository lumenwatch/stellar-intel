/**
 * Badges carry status, and status on this product means one of three things: an
 * anchor answered, an anchor failed, or nobody has looked yet. Those map onto
 * the three semantic status tokens rather than six raw Tailwind hues — a
 * six-colour badge set spends the whole colour budget on labels and leaves the
 * accent nothing to mark.
 *
 * `info` deliberately resolves to the neutral treatment. It was a blue badge,
 * which introduced a fourth hue in order to say "this is a note".
 *
 * `mock` is the one variant that must never be quiet. It marks data that is
 * illustrative rather than observed, on a product whose entire claim is the
 * difference between those two things, so it gets a ring and uppercase mono
 * instead of a soft orange fill that reads as decoration.
 *
 * Square, not pill-shaped: `rounded-full` on a status chip is decoration, and
 * this system ships hard edges.
